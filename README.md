# Test Task Kit Global

## Overview

This project is a React and TypeScript application built with Vite and Next.js. It features a post management service with Firebase integration, state management using Redux Toolkit, and a modular UI based on Radix UI components and Tailwind CSS.

The app allows users to review and manage posts â€” including adding, editing, removing, commenting, viewing detailed information, as well as sorting and filtering posts by multiple parameters.

## Core Components

- **UI Components**  
  Located in **src/components/ui/**, these include dialogs, drawers, tooltips, and cards used throughout the app.

- **Post Components**  
  Components such as [Post](src/components/Post.tsx) and [EditPost](src/components/EditPost.tsx) handle displaying posts and providing editing functionality.

- **State Management**  
  Redux Toolkit is used for state management. See [posts.slice.ts](src/store/posts.slice.ts) for actions like `initiate`, `addPostAction`, and `updatePostAction`.

- **Firebase Integration**  
  CRUD operations for posts are implemented in [firebase.ts](src/firebase.ts), integrating Firebase Firestore.
